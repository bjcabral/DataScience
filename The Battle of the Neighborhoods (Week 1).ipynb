This is a real situation, a friend is looking to open a fastfood franchise in my town (Falling Waters, WV). It is a very small highway town in the Interstate 81 corridor. Due to its proximity to an interstate highway, the town is populated with many fastfood places and other larger restaurant venues. He already owns several of the same franchise in the area and is looking for the ideal place to open his next one. Some of the competitors include McDonals, Burger King, FiveGuys, and many others. His franchise offers breakfast items all day, hashbrowns, coffee, smoothies, among other items. Currently, there is no data related to the popularity of these other venues, or their concentration around the area. My task is to recommend the best place to open the new venue considering the following attributes: distance from other similar venues, popularity of similar venues in the area, consideration to his other existing similar franchises and their distance from new venue, population in the area, highway traffic volume, and possibly, volume of traffic exiting the highway and intercepting with the new venue.
